## 🛠️ Featured Projects
Here are some of my notable projects with more in-depth details:

- **[INVENTORY-MANAGE-MENT-SYSTEM](https://github.com/Imanirud/INVENTORY-MANAGE-MENT-SYSTEM)**  
  *Language: Java*  
  A comprehensive GUI desktop application for inventory management, designed for small to mid-sized stores. It handles product inventory, customers, suppliers, users, and transactions efficiently.  
  **Key Features**:  
  - Manage products, stock levels, sales, and purchases with automatic stock updates.  
  - Supports two user roles: Administrator (full access, including user management) and Employee.  
  - Built-in search functionality across all sections.  
  - Auto-retrieve product details via codes during transactions.  
  - Tracks user login/logout times for security.  
  **Technologies**: Java Swing (GUI), JDBC API (database connectivity), MySQL (backend).  
  **Installation & Usage**: Requires JDK 16+. Download the ZIP, import the SQL schema into MySQL, and run the JAR file. Default login: root/root. Edit credentials in DBCredentials.xml if needed. Access dashboard for all operations.  
  **Demo**: Includes screenshots of login, dashboard, and various modules, plus an ER diagram for the database.

- **[CRYPTO-CURRENCY-PREDICTION](https://github.com/Imanirud/CRYPTO-CURRENCY-PREDICTION)**  
  *Language: Jupyter Notebook*  
  A machine learning project leveraging deep learning to predict Bitcoin prices (extendable to other cryptocurrencies) using historical data from Poloniex. Focuses on time-series forecasting with advanced neural networks.  
  **Key Features**:  
  - Implements LSTM, GRU, and 1D CNN models for price prediction over 80-minute horizons based on 1280 minutes of past data.  
  - Data preprocessing with MinMaxScaler; uses Mean Squared Error as the loss function.  
  - Includes regularization experiments and baseline comparisons (e.g., random walk, linear regression).  
  - Visualization of validation results in dedicated notebooks.  
  **Technologies**: Python 2.7, TensorFlow 1.2.0, Keras 2.1.1, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, h5py.  
  **Installation & Usage**: Install listed dependencies, run DataCollection.ipynb and PastSampler.ipynb for data prep, then execute model scripts like CNN.py or open Jupyter notebooks for plots. Best model: 1-layer LSTM with tanh + Leaky ReLU (validation loss: 0.00004).  
  **Demo**: Result plots available, e.g., LSTM validation graph showing low loss and accurate predictions vs. baselines.

- **[myfirstdocument](https://github.com/Imanirud/myfirstdocument)**  
  *Language: HTML*  
  An initial project developed as part of a job challenge, focusing on basic web development concepts. Details are minimal, but it serves as an early exploration of HTML structuring.

- **[anirudh](https://github.com/Imanirud/anirudh)**  
  A personal experimental repository for foundational development practice. Currently in early stages with limited public details—more to come as it evolves.

- **[Imanirud](https://github.com/Imanirud/Imanirud)**  
  My profile repository, hosting this README and serving as a hub for ongoing personal experiments and profile enhancements.
